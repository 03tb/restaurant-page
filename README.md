# Restaurant Page Project
## [Link to live demo](https://03tb.github.io/restaurant-page/)

This project was my introduction to using Webpack to bundle and package my scripts and sources.

Other than Skeleton HTML, it relies solely on Javascript to insert the information you see on the page.

Currently it's only designed for monitor sizes at 1440p and 4k.
